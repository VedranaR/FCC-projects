                Galileo Galilei was an Italian polymath: astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and
                mathematician. He has been called the "father of observational astronomy", the "father of modern
                physics", the "father of scientific method",and the "father of science".

              He played a major role in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. His contributions to
              observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the
              four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and
              analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved
              military compass and other instruments. Galileo's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was
              controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.

            <p class="mb-3">
              He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed
              stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that
              heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly
              contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.".
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to
              attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until
              this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant.
              He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. While under house arrest, he wrote one of his
              best-known works, Two New Sciences, in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on
              the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.
